![commits](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/BDFD-LearningGround/Cousera_Google-Data-Analytics-Professional-Certificate?label=Last%20Commit%20)

The Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing (CEMC) is the largest outreach organization of its kind in Canada and our mission is to increase interest, enjoyment, confidence, and ability in mathematics and computer science among learners and educators in Canada and internationally. We do this through a commitment to our core values: future readiness, access, community and impact.

**Course prerequisite**

Mathematics and computing contests are a fun way for students to grow their problem-solving skills, build confidence and get creative with math and computer science. Designed by teams of expert mathematicians and educators for Grades 5 to 12, CEMC contests are a great fit for students across a range of abilitiesâ€”from learners who want to explore math and computer science and develop their confidence to advanced students who want to stretch their limits.
